Notes:

1) on paper sheet when discussing with Peter

2) from his e-mail:
Attached the four .py files. I've changed gconf->codes in tew_tools.py.
Don't forget to perhaps also alter n_aim = 10 (line 49 in tew_tools.py), since that is probably a rather low number of thresholds (n_aim is the number of thresholds that I subsample to).
The image attached is the random median TEW curve, i.e. the output of TEW_illustration.py.
Have fun :)
Pete
